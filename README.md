# PhysioVision

PhysioVision is an AI-guided home rehabilitation prototype for the Tencent Age
Well Hackathon. It helps older adults complete low-risk physiotherapy exercises
with real-time camera-based movement feedback while keeping physiotherapists
connected to progress trends.

## Prototype flows

- Editorial landing page and product story
- Three-step AI plan intake based on goals and profile information
- MediaPipe-powered pose tracking with live form cues and repetition counting
- Patient progress and clinical escalation preview
- Online physiotherapist booking prototype
- Physiotherapist monitoring dashboard

## Run locally

Camera access requires a local web server rather than opening `index.html`
directly:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open `http://localhost:4173`.

The pose model and web fonts load from external CDNs, so an internet connection
is required for the full exercise-guidance experience.

## Safety

This hackathon prototype is not a medical device. It is intended to demonstrate
low-risk exercise guidance and does not diagnose conditions or replace a
qualified health professional.
